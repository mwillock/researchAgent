# Research Agent
## Purpose:
Creating a research agent with the intention of searching the web for credible doc/text with the capabilities of being a coding assistant. 
This is purely for educational purposes 

## Overview
- **FastAPI** app served by **Uvicorn** (local dev).
- **Ollama** hosts models locally and exposes a REST API.
- **Provider** pattern lets us swap models/providers without touching routes.
- **Typed settings** via `pydantic-settings` (reads `.env` in dev, real env in CI/Pro

### Architecture (request flow)
Client â†’ `POST /assist/explain` (FastAPI) â†’ Service selects model â†’ Provider calls `OLLAMA_URL/api/generate` â†’ Ollama runs model â†’ Response JSON.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- Ollama running locally (`http://localhost:11434`)
- Pulled models:
  - `llama3.1:8b`
  - `codellama:7b`
